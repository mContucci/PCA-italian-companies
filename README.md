# Principal Component Analysis in Software Production Sector

This repository contains data obtained from the AIDA database and represents a university project on the analysis of the software production sector using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The work was carried out in 2020 by Gabriele Pillitteri, Simone Benzi, and Marco Contucci.

## Project Information

- **Project Contributors:** Gabriele Pillitteri, Simone Benzi, Marco Contucci
- **Project Year:** 2020
- **Programming Language Used:** R

## Project Description

This repository contains data extracted from the AIDA database used for Principal Component Analysis in the software production sector. The main objectives of the project include:

1. Data extraction and preparation from the AIDA database.
2. Application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the primary factors influencing the software production sector.
3. Visualization of the analysis results through graphs and tables.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains data obtained from the AIDA database.
- `scripts/`: Includes R scripts used for Principal Component Analysis.
- `results/`: Contains the analysis results, such as graphs and tables.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Instructions for Execution

To reproduce or extend the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Download the data from the AIDA database and place it in the `data/` folder.
2. Execute the R scripts in the `scripts/` folder in the appropriate order.
3. The analysis results will be generated in the `results/` folder.

## Analysis Results

The results of the Principal Component Analysis will be thoroughly documented in the `results/` folder. These results include graphs and tables showing the data structure in the software production sector and the major factors influencing it.
